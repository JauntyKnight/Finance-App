I'm sorry, I'm too lazy to write this file, yet

ToDo:

- In the Add Transaction, New Account and New Category dialogs, the 'Ok' button should be unavailable (i.e. grayed out) until the user has entered information in all the required dialog fields.

- The New Account dialog allows me to type letters in the Balance field.  Instead, only digits should be accepted there.

- If I try to add two accounts or categories with the same name, a dialog appears that just says "Error".  Instead, there should be a more specific error message (e.g. 'Duplicate account name').

- Filter Button
- Exchange Tab
